This is a simple sort, search and overview algorithm I made to look at my own financial data. It is not very useful for anyone else, as it is made to look at text files organized the way my bank sorts it. Categories and sources are also hard-coded to fit my own income and spending (it'd be easy to change, but it's still hard coded as the only purpose of this was just to get the overview I wanted for myself).

I uploaded this as an example of something I coded on my spare time just for fun (and function... I needed something to do while sorting my music playlists). It is a mess and completely improvised/unplanned. If I was going to be judged by it or be graded, I would tear it down and code it again from scratch, but this was only meant to work and be used by me, so there it is.


The text file being read should be in the following format:

31.12.2017	3.69	description of transaction
29.12.2017	-330	description of this other transaction
29.12.2017	-930	description of a third transaction
